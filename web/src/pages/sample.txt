The individual exhibits significant challenges in understanding emotions, comprehending conversations, and providing empathetic responses, which impact their social and professional interactions. They struggle to recognize and interpret basic and complex emotional cues, often misidentifying expressions and failing to detect emotional undertones in conversations. Comprehension difficulties include processing indirect language, retaining information, and following group discussions, particularly when speech is fast-paced or nuanced. Empathetic responses are limited, often characterized by logical rather than emotional acknowledgment of othersâ€™ feelings. These deficits may stem from neurological conditions, cognitive impairments, or psychological factors. Interventions such as emotion recognition training, active listening techniques, and empathy-building exercises are recommended to improve their communication abilities and enhance their quality of life.
